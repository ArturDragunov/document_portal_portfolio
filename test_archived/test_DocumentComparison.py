    Creates a fake "uploaded file" object by reading a local PDF file's raw bytes
    and wrapping them in io.BytesIO() to create a file-like object in memory.
    This mimics what happens when users upload files through web interfaces 
    (like Streamlit's st.file_uploader()), which return BytesIO objects.
    
    Allows testing PDF processing pipeline with local files that behave 
    like uploaded ones, without waiting for real user uploads.

        the raw bytes of the uploaded file. This class replicates that exact 
        interface - when something calls .getbuffer() on this fake upload object, 
        it returns the _buffer (the file's bytes) just like a real Streamlit 
        upload would.
