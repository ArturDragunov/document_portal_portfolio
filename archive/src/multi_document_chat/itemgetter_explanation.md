## What is `itemgetter`?

`itemgetter` comes from Python’s built-in `operator` module.  
It creates a function that, when given a dictionary (or list/tuple), extracts a specific key (or index).  

### Example

```python
from operator import itemgetter

data = {"input": "What is LangChain?", "chat_history": ["Hello", "Hi there!"]}

get_input = itemgetter("input")
get_history = itemgetter("chat_history")

print(get_input(data))      # → "What is LangChain?"
print(get_history(data))    # → ["Hello", "Hi there!"]
```

This is equivalent to writing:

```python
lambda d: d["input"]
```

So **`itemgetter("input")` is just a shortcut for getting `data["input"]`.**  

---

## How is `itemgetter` used in the chain?

Your code:

```python
self.chain = (
    {
        "context": retrieve_docs,
        "input": itemgetter("input"),
        "chat_history": itemgetter("chat_history"),
    }
    | self.qa_prompt
    | self.llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

### Step 1: Input to the chain

When you call:

```python
result = self.chain.invoke({
    "input": "Who discovered penicillin?",
    "chat_history": ["User: Hello", "AI: Hi! How can I help you?"]
})
```

This dictionary is the **data source**.

---

### Step 2: Mapping dictionary

The mapping dictionary transforms that data:

```python
{
    "context": retrieve_docs,                  # retriever function
    "input": itemgetter("input"),              # pulls the "input" value
    "chat_history": itemgetter("chat_history") # pulls the "chat_history" value
}
```

After resolution, you get:

```python
{
    "context": "Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928...",
    "input": "Who discovered penicillin?",
    "chat_history": ["User: Hello", "AI: Hi! How can I help you?"]
}
```

---

### Step 3: Feeding into the prompt

Your `qa_prompt` template expects `{context}`, `{chat_history}`, and `{input}`.  
So it becomes something like:

```
System: You are an assistant...
Context: Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928...
Chat History:
User: Hello
AI: Hi! How can I help you?
Human: Who discovered penicillin?
```

---

### Step 4: LLM & Output

That prompt goes into the LLM → the output is parsed by `StrOutputParser()` → returned as the final answer.

---

## Why not write `data["input"]` directly?

Because in a chain, we don’t know in advance what the incoming dictionary will look like.  
Instead of hardcoding `data["input"]`, we pass a function (`itemgetter("input")`) which LangChain automatically applies to whatever data dictionary flows through the pipeline.

This makes the chain **composable and flexible**.

---

✅ **Summary:**  
- `itemgetter("input")` is equivalent to `lambda d: d["input"]`.  
- It’s used in LangChain to flexibly extract values from the input dictionary.  
- Data flows: User input → mapping dictionary (with itemgetters + retriever) → prompt → LLM → output.
